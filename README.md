# Color Wave Analysis, Semantic Mapping, and Sequence Optimization
This repository contains a full suite of Jupyter Notebooks for advanced color-based data processing, semantic meaning extraction, and spatiotemporal sequence optimization.
The project explores the intersection between color clusters, emotional meaning, and wave-like properties in time-space-light metaphor models.

# Module 1: Color Wave Momentum Analysis
Overview:
Treats color sequences as wave functions, calculating and visualizing their momentum properties in 2D space.

Features:

Momentum calculation using wave physics principles

Multiple predefined pathways mapped to color sequences

Comprehensive visualization:

Real and imaginary parts of momentum

Magnitude and phase

Trajectory visualization over time

# Module 2: Color-Word Semantic Analysis
Overview:
Analyzes the semantic relationship between colors and words using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Key Components:

RGB normalization

Word-color semantic similarity calculation via spaCy

Sentiment analysis with TextBlob

Features:

Processes CSV input with color and word associations

Calculates semantic similarity and suggests replacements

Provides detailed scoring combining sentiment and color affinity

# Module 3: Color Sequence Optimization (La Matriz Consulting Tool)
Overview:
This new module integrates color clustering, semantic enrichment, and momentum optimization to design optimal color sequences for individuals or businesses based on specific emotional or strategic goals.

Key Components:

K-Means clustering of colors based on RGB + semantic features

PCA visualization of color clusters

Calculation of momentum between color transitions

Optimization algorithms to maximize or minimize momentum based on user needs

Generation of thematic color sequences (hope, trust, energy, calm, nature)

Semantic coherence scoring to ensure emotionally consistent sequences

Use Case Example:

A client wants more time and calm.
We apply constraints (e.g., r > 128) because red represents time, and optimize for low momentum.
This leads to sequences dominated by colors like nude and white â€” representing a pause in time.

## Fetch, cluster, and optimize based on client constraints

Data Requirements
For Wave Analysis
No external file required. Uses predefined color sequences.

For Semantic and Optimization Analysis
Requires a CSV file (la matrice.csv) with columns:

'color' â€“ Color name

'r', 'g', 'b' â€“ RGB values

'matrice' â€“ Original semantic word

'matrice1' â€“ Additional semantic word (optional)

# Notes
The wave analysis assumes non-commutative properties in color sequences, aligning with a conformal time model.

Semantic analysis relies on spaCy's trained English model; results may vary slightly based on language context.

Color sequence optimization incorporates both emotional semantics and transition physics to recommend strategies grounded in the client's original palette.
